FileInfo AkelPad plugin
-----------------------

See \Docs\FileInfo-*.txt for description

To compile the plugin, you'll need AkelPad plugin API units that could be found in the neighbour repository "AkelPad_AkelDefs". Clone this repo to folder <Plugin>\Source\#AkelDefs.

*** Delphi 2010 and XE2 only ***
To minimize the size of this plugin you need D2010/XE2 MiniRTL units located in the neighbour repository "MiniRTL". Clone this repo to folder <Plugin>\Source\#MiniRTL.
Other Delphi versions not implemented, sorry.
